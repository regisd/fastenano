## Objective

Unstuck nano transactions.

## Context

[Nano](https://nano.org/) is a feeless cryptocurrency payment system. 

Since [January 2021](https://twitter.com/patrickluberus/status/1352247543149817858)
the nano network has been under a [DoS attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack).
There has been a quick workarounds in
[v21.3](https://medium.com/nanocurrency/recent-dos-nano-network-attack-and-v21-3-fixes-97b9b7297f9)
and longer term 
[plans to prevent spam](https://senatus.substack.com/p/nanos-latest-innovation-feeless-spam).

However, in the meantime, [the network is slowed down](https://nanocrawler.cc/network),
and some transactions are stuck.
Some Redditors are kind enough to help
[unstuck transactions](https://www.reddit.com/r/nanocurrency/comments/mo5gpr/processing_your_stuck_nano_transactions/).

This project aims at automating the process.
